## GIT COMMANDS
For the initial pull:
```git
git clone https://github.com/ameniawy/databases_project.git
```

if you want to create a new branch:
```git
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

if you want to switch to another existing branch:
```git
git checkout <branch_name>
```

when you want to save your work and upload:
```git
git add --all or git add .
git commit -m "add your commit message here"
git push origin <your_branch_name>
```

if you need to pull new changes to your local machine from a certain branch
```git
git pull origin <branch_name> 
```

for example I want to take the changes made to the master branch but I'm on branch meniawy
```git
git pull origin master
```


### IMPORTANT:
1) Always pull from master and fix conflicts before requesting a merge.
Solve your own conflicts
2) Always push to your branch only.
